# Predict price from given mileage using the trained model
# STEP :
# - Loads the coefficients (theta0, theta1) saved by the training script
# - Takes one or more mileage values as input (user input or file)
# - Calculates and displays predicted price(s) using the formula theta0 + theta1 * mileage


# Loads data (theta0, theta1, mean_x, std_x) saved inside "saved.txt".

# Calc and display the predicted price by using the correct formula.
